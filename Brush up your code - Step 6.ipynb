    "# Fundamentals\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects that interact with each other to perform the program functions. Each object can be characterized by a state and behavior. An object keeps the current state in the fields and the behavior in the methods."

    "# Theory : Basic principles of OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four basic principles of OOP. They are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data encapsulation is the mechanism of hiding the internal data of objects from the world. All interaction with the object and its data are performed through its public methods. Encapsulation allows programmers to protect the object from inconsistency.\n",
    "2. Data abstraction means that objects should provide the simplified, abstract version of their implementations. The details of their internal work usually aren't necessary for the user, so there's no need to represent them. Abstraction also means that only the most relevant features of the object will be presented.\n",
    "3. Inheritance is a mechanism for defining parent-child relationships between classes. Often objects are very similar, so inheritance allows programmers to reuse common logic and at the same time introduce unique concepts into the classes.\n",
    "4. Polymorphism literally means one name and many forms, and it concerns the inheritance of the classes. Just as the name suggests, it allows programmers to define different logic of the same method. So, the name (or interface) stays the same, but the actions performed may be different. In practice, it is done with overloading or overriding."

    "# Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "The key notion of the OOP is, naturally, an object. There are a lot of real-world objects around you: pets, buildings, cars, computers, planes, you name it. Even a computer program may be considered as an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's possible to identify some important characteristics for real-world objects. For instance, for a building, we can consider a number of floors, the year of construction and the total area. Another example is a plane that can accommodate a certain number of passengers and transfer you from one city to another. These characteristics constitute the object's attributes and methods. Attributes characterize objects' data or states, and methods â€” its behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "In OOP, everything can be considered an object. Programs are made from different objects interacting with each other. An object's state and behavior are usually placed together, but it's not always so. Sometimes, we will see objects without a state or methods. This, of course, depends on the purpose of the program and the nature of an object."

Since they are characterized by double underscores they are often called dunders. \n",
